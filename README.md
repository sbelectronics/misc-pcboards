# Misc pcboards

This repo contains miscellaneous pcboards that I have decided to provide gerbers. Not all of my
pcboards are represented here. Some of them (for example, Atari, QX10, and Heathkit boards) I
have not chosen to make the gerbers public at this time.

Boards present here are often older ones from projects past. You should use the gerbers at your
own risk; I cannot guarantee the validity of some of these older projects. I am also not able
to provide any support for these old projects.
