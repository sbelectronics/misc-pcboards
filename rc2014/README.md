# Scott's RC2014 Projects

https://www.smbaker.com/

These are schematics and gerbers for various rc2014 projects over the years. These are not "official" RC2014
boards. These are projects that I made on my website at www.smbaker.com. Most of these RC2014 boards are
described in blog posts on the website. The gerbers should be usable at a place like jlcpcb. Most of the
gerbers I had to run off manually for this dump to github, since the boards were originally published on
osh park. Please scrutinize carefully before you order anything.
